The following is the code repository for Young Ha Yoo's 2023 independent work project. 

## Dataset
The dataset that was used can be found at https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

## Auxiliary Files
Auxiliary files that were created as part of the programs (e.g. tokenized reviews files) are large in size and, thus, can be found at the following Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_gfR5-hJmY-LlTBdGEyicXvIoZZe8K4Q/view?usp=sharing
